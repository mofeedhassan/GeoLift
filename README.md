Framework to enrich geographic content in the Semantic Web
=======
What is Geolift?
It is a spatial mapping component developed as part from GeoKnow Project. GeoKnow is a 3 year project funded by the European Commission within the FP7 Information and Communication Technologies Work Programme (Grant Agreement No. 318159). 
GeoKnow addresses the problem of linking geospatial data from heterogeneous information systems and uses the web as a 
platform to exploit this data. - See more at: http://geoknow.eu/Project.html. One of the partners in this project is 
AKSW group in Mathematical and Informatic Institute in Liepzig University, Germany.

What is goal of GeoLift?
The goal of GeoLift is to enrich RDF datasets with geo-spatial information. GeoLit relies on three atomic modules based on dereferencing (Use the semantics of RDF to fetch geographical information from DBpedia and attach it to the resource in the other ontology), linking (Use link discovery to map resources in an input knowledge base to resources in a knowledge that contains explicit geographical information. Once having established the link between the two resources, GeoLift can then resolve to the approach defined above.) and NLP.
