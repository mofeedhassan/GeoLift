GeoLift
=======

The goal of GeoLift is to enrich RDF datasets with geo-spatial information. GeoLit relies on three atomic modules based on dereferencing (Use the semantics of
RDF to fetch geographical information from DBpedia and attach it to the resource in the other ontology), linking (Use link discovery to map resources
in an input knowledge base to resources in a knowledge that contains explicit geographical information. Once having established the link between the two resources, GeoLift can
then resolve to the approach defined above.) and NLP.

I implemented tow modules Dereferencing and Linking.
